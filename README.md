# pythonWithMinecraft
Hi, this repository contains a bunch of simple projects in Python Language with Mynecraft Python API and Spigot.

# Learn to Program with Minecraft
In this repository you will see how programming works with Minecraft API Spigot, and then use what you learned to create structures using code, write mini-games, and personalize Minecraft tools adding different functions!

# First of all
You will install 5 things before code with Minecraft:
- Minecraft
- Java
- Python 3
- Minecraft Python API
- Spigot Minecraft Server

# Installing Minecraft
1. Go to the https://www.minecraft.net/pt-br/download
2. Under the Minecraft for Windows section, find the Minecraft.msi link and click it to download it. If you’re given the option to save or open the file, select Save File.
3. Wait for the download and Run the file.
4. Click in Next buttons and then Install button.
5. After installation completes, click Finish.

# Installing Python
1. Go to http://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the button labeled Download Python 3.5.0. (You will use Python 3 latest version to code with Minecraft)
3. Python will begin to download, click Save File.
4. When the installer has downloaded Run the Installer.
5. When the installer opens, select the Add Python 3.5 to Path checkbox and Install Now.
6. A dialog might ask whether you want to allow the program to install software on the computer. Click Yes and then wait for Python to install.
7. Click on the Finish button.

IMPORTANT: If you get an error message that says pip is not recognized, that means you didn’t install Python correctly. Go back to “Installing Python” and reinstall Python. Make sure you select the checkbox that says Add Python 3.5 to Path.

# Installing Java
1. Go to http://www.java.com/en/download/
2. Click the Free Java Download button. Then click the Agree and Start Free Download button.
3. When the installer has downloaded, click it. If a dialog pops up asking whether you want to let the program make changes to your computer, choose Yes.
4. When the installer opens, click Install.
5. If the program asks to upload or download some another thing like yahoo don't update and click Next.
6. When it finishes click Close button.

To verify if Java has downloaded properly:
1. Click on the Start Menu and type cmd in the search box, open the cmd program.
2. In the cmd window, type java -version at the prompt and press enter.
3. If you get an error that says “‘Java’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file,” Java hasn’t installed properly. To fix this, try reinstalling Java and running it again. If you still get this error after reinstalling, go to http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml for more information.

# Installing Minecraft Python API and SPIGOT
A standard Minecraft single-player game does not support an API. Instead, your programs will interact with a Minecraft server, which allows the use of APIs. Minecraft servers are mostly used online so that many people can play together in a single game world.
Both multiplayer and single-player Minecraft servers allow you to use an API with Minecraft.
1. Go to https://www.nostarch.com/pythonwithminecraft/ and download the Minecraft Tools.zip file for Windows.
2. When the file has downloaded, right-click it and choose Extract All. You will be asked where you want to put the extracted files. Click the Browse button and go to your My Documents folder. Click the Make a New Folder button and call the new folder Minecraft Python. Select this folder and click OK. Click Extract to extract the files.
3. Go to the Minecraft Python folder in your My Documents folder, where you should see the extracted files.
4. Open the Minecraft Tools folder.
5. Double-click the file called Install_API. This will open a new window and install the Minecraft Python API. If you get a warning message, click Run Anyway.
6. When the installation completes, press any key to finish.

# Running SPIGOT and creating a Multiplay Server
1. Go to your Minecraft Python folder and open your Minecraft Tools folder.
2. In the Minecraft Tools folder, double-click the Start_Server file. If you get a message asking whether you want to allow access, click Allow.
3. Spigot will start your Minecraft server. You’ll see a window pop up with a bunch of text in it while Spigot generates the game world for you. When the Server is ready, it will shows a message like "Done", keep this window open.
4. Open Minecraft and click Multiplayer.
5. Click the Add Server button.
6. In the Server Name box, name your server Minecraft Python World, and in the Server Address box, type localhost, then click Done.
7. Double-click Minecraft Python World, and the world created by Spigot will open.

# After all of setting set up try this test:
1. Open Spigot by going to your Minecraft Tools folder and clicking Start_Server.
2. Open Minecraft and connect to the Spigot server by selecting Minecraft Python World from the multiplayer menu.
3. Hit esc on your keyboard to free your cursor from the Minecraft window, and then open a Python shell in IDLE.
4. You’ll need to have these three pieces of software open whenever you write programs that interact with Minecraft!!
